# About this repository

## Features
This program downloads Blinkist's ‚Äúfree daily‚Äù in all available languages.
It saves‚Ä¶
- the (almost) raw API responses
  - as YAML
  - This includes things like categories or ratings which are not saved elsewhere.
- the text version
  - as Markdown
    - the unmodified HTML-formatted content + custom Markdown-formatted structure
    - üõà Consider using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert to other formats like HTML, PDF, EPUB, etc.
- the audio version
  - as one M4A file per chapter (no modifications)
- the cover image
  - as JPEG (no modifications)
  - in the highest resolution available (1080√ó1080)

## Installation

```bash
# First, clone the repository

# Then, install the dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Installation via _setuptools_ and _pip_ is currently not supported.

## Usage
Just run the [`main.py`](main.py) executable, providing a path to a ‚Äúlibrary directory‚Äù, where every book will be saved in its own subdirectory:
```bash
$ python main.py ~/Library/Blinkist
```
Some CLI options are available; see `main.py --help`.
For other options, you need to modify [`blinkist/config.py`](blinkist/config.py) to your needs.


## Motivation
While https://github.com/ptrstn/dailyblink is/was broken due to changes to Blinkist's frontend (https://github.com/ptrstn/dailyblink/issues/32),
I wrote my own Blinkist downloader from scratch.
In contrast to the original, this one relies on Blinkist's API, which might be more stable than scraping with *beautifulsoup*.

## Limitations
- Downloading arbitrary books with Blinkist Premium is not supported out of the box. It might be easy to get it working, but I didn't test it. There's other tools for that anyway.
- ID3 tags are not set.
- The formatting of the markdown export differs a little from @ptrstn's.
- Apparently, this doesn't work for everyone. [[1]](https://github.com/ptrstn/dailyblink/issues/32#issuecomment-1155508522)
